# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Testing, first line to test git and remember all this stuff...

Day 0: June 23, Friday

Progress: Did exercise 40 on LPTHW, didn't master it though. Intend on mastering
it next.

Thoughts: I really hope I stick to this. I know I'm adding in tutorials and such
but since I'm such a lazy bum I think it is both required and a stepping stone.

Day 1: June 27, Tuesday

Progress: did exercise 42 on lpthw, got some practice with classes and objects
and sort-of understand it but not really. Will need more practice.

Thoughts: I skipped a bunch of days cause weekend and you know...lazy and stuff.
Will try not to. In fact I didnt even finish my hour because my eyes are weary.

Day 2: June 29, Thursday

Progress: Decided to trash lpthw and the java thing...Just really didn't 
interest me and doing it would have taken much more effort for reward than
doing something else that is interesting. Decided to go through with 
the youtube thing "Think like a programmer" by v anton spraul. Did the problem
of permutation on the city utilities.

Thoughts: Proud of myself, there was lots of debugging. I did the pseudocode on
notebook and then wrote it down and googled solutions to certain issues...the
whole 9 yards.
