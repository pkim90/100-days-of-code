### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Testing, first line to test git and remember all this stuff...

Day 0: June 23, Friday

Progress: Did exercise 40 on LPTHW, didn't master it though. Intend on mastering
it next.

Thoughts: I really hope I stick to this. I know I'm adding in tutorials and such
but since I'm such a lazy bum I think it is both required and a stepping stone.


Day 1: June 27, Tuesday

Progress: did exercise 42 on lpthw, got some practice with classes and objects
and sort-of understand it but not really. Will need more practice.

Thoughts: I skipped a bunch of days cause weekend and you know...lazy and stuff.
Will try not to. In fact I didnt even finish my hour because my eyes are weary.
